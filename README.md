# Problems

1. Generate two random numbers and print their mean, variance, and standard deviation.
2. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for a list/array containing 10 random numbers.
3. Generate twenty random numbers from 0 to 100 and print the largest and smallest numbers.
4. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100, then output all the even numbers from 0 to the random number.
5. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd numbers from 40 to the random number. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd numbers from 0 to 40.
6. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd numbers from that number down to 40. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd numbers from that number down to 0.
7. Write a function that returns the total discount ($), given the original amount and discount percentage. Return a warning if the discount amount is greater than 100 or less that 0 percent. Test the results.
8. Class it up. Wrap a class around the last function. Instantiate the class and call the function. Then use unittests and rspec to test.
9. Generate n random numbers from 0 to 100, then output them in ascending order.
10. Generate a random number from 1000 to 9999 and output the sum of its digits. For example, if the number is 1049, then the output should be 14.
