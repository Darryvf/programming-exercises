# Problems

1. Generate two random numbers and print their mean, variance, and standard deviation.
2. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for a list/array containing 10 random numbers.
3. Generate twenty random numbers from 0 to 100 and print the largest and smallest numbers.
4. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100, then output all the even numbers from 0 to the random number.
5. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd numbers from 40 to the random number. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd numbers from 0 to 40.
6. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd numbers from 40 down to that number. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd numbers from that number down to 0.
