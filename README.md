# Problems

*Solving with brute force*

1. Generate two random integers and print their mean, variance, and standard deviation.
2. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for a list/array containing 10 random integers.
3. Generate twenty random integers from 0 to 100 and print the largest and smallest integers.
4. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100, then output all the even integers from 0 to the random number.
5. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd integers from 40 to the random number. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd integers from 0 to 40.
6. Generate a single random number, from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 40 then output all the odd integers from that number down to 40. If the number is less than 40, output all the odd integers from that number down to 0.
7. Write a function that returns the total discount ($), given the original amount and discount percentage. Return a warning if the discount amount is greater than 100 or less that 0 percent. Test the results.
8. Class it up. Wrap a class around the last function. Instantiate the class and call the function. Then use unittests and rspec to test.
9. Generate n random integers from 0 to 100, then output them in ascending order.
10. Generate a random number from 1000 to 9999 and output the sum of its digits. For example, if the number is 1049, then the output should be 14.
11. Generate a random number from 1000 to 9999 and output the sum of its digits, repeatedly, dropping the left-most digit after each iteration, until there is only one digit only. For example, if the number is 1049, then the output should be 14, 13, 13, 9.
12. Generate two random integers from 0 to 100 and output the smallest number such that each shares a least common denominator (aside for 1). For example, 18 and 6 should return 6, while 9 and 4 should return False. Return False if the two numbers are equal.
13. Write a function that takes two random integers as arguments and returns the least common multiple.
14. Write a program that calculates and shows the value of (x to the nth power). Let both integers fall within the range of 2 through 20.
15. Write a function that returns ten lines. On the first line there is one '#' character. On the second there are two. And so on. This will create a nice triangle.
16. Write a function that takes two random, 10-character strings as arguments, which returns True when the first string starts with the first two characters in the second string - and false otherwise.
17. Write a function that takes a paragraph as an argument and returns an array that contains each string as an element.
18. Create a simple webpage that includes three tags, an `<h1>`, `<h2>` and `<p>`, then using jQuery, create an alert that outputs the tag name when you click on the tag. 
19. Write a function that takes an object/hash/dictionary of people (keys) and their subseuqent ages as its argument, and then it returns the name of the oldest living person.
20. Write two functions. Both take a base and an exponent as arguments and return the value of base^exponent. Use recursion in the first function and a loop in the second. Benchmark the results.
